###[Rubberduck](http://rubberduckvba.com/)

The VBA language definition has been taken from Rubberduck

> It's an add-in for the VBA IDE, the glorious *Visual Basic Editor* (VBE) - which hasn't seen an update in this century, but that's still in use everywhere around the world. Rubberduck wants to give its users access to features you would find in the VBE if it had kept up with the features of Visual Studio and other IDE's in the past, oh, *decade* or so.

> Rubberduck wants to help its users write better, cleaner, maintainable code. The many **code inspections** and **refactoring tools** help harmlessly making changes to the code, and **unit testing** helps writing a *safety net* that makes it easy to know exactly what broke when you made that *small little harmless modification*.

> Rubberduck wants to bring VBA into the 21st century, and wants to see more open-source VBA repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/) - VBA code and **source control** don't traditionally exactly work hand in hand; unless you've automated it, exporting each module one by one to your local repository, fetching the remote changes, re-importing every module one by one back into the project, ...is *a little bit* tedious. Rubberduck integrates Git into the IDE, and handles all the file handling behind the scenes - a bit like Visual Studio's *Team Explorer*.


###[ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/)

Language parsing is empowered by the awesomeness of ANTLR.

> **What is ANTLR?**

> *ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.*

We're not doing half of what we could be doing with this amazing tool. Try it, see for yourself!
